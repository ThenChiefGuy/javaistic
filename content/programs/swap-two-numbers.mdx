description: Learn different ways to swap two numbers in Java — using a temporary variable, arithmetic operations, and bitwise XOR — with clear examples and outputs.

Swapping two numbers is a common beginner-friendly exercise in Java. Below are three simple ways to do it:

- Using a temporary variable (safest and most readable)
- Using arithmetic operations (beware of overflow for very large numbers)
- Using bitwise XOR (no temp variable; works for integers)

Before you start, you may want to review:

- [Java Variables and Literals](/docs/variables-and-literals)
- [Java Operators](/docs/operators)
- [Java Basic Input and Output](/docs/basic-input-output)

## 1) Swap Using a Temporary Variable

This is the most straightforward and recommended approach.

### Example

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;

    System.out.println("Before swap: a = " + a + ", b = " + b);

    int temp = a; // store a
    a = b;        // put b into a
    b = temp;     // put original a into b

    System.out.println("After swap:  a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
  }
}
```

#### Output

```plaintext
Before swap: a = 10, b = 20
After swap:  a = 20, b = 10
```

## 2) Swap Without Temp (Arithmetic)

Uses addition and subtraction. Note: This can overflow if the numbers are near the integer limits.

### Example

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 15;
    int b = 27;

    System.out.println("Before swap: a = " + a + ", b = " + b);

    a = a + b; // a becomes sum
    b = a - b; // b becomes original a
    a = a - b; // a becomes original b

    System.out.println("After swap:  a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
  }
}
```

#### Output

```plaintext
Before swap: a = 15, b = 27
After swap:  a = 27, b = 15
```

## 3) Swap Using XOR (No Temp)

Works for integers and avoids extra memory, but is less readable for beginners.

### Example

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 9;

    System.out.println("Before swap: a = " + a + ", b = " + b);

    a = a ^ b; // Step 1
    b = a ^ b; // Step 2: now b is original a
    a = a ^ b; // Step 3: now a is original b

    System.out.println("After swap:  a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
  }
}
```

#### Output

```plaintext
Before swap: a = 5, b = 9
After swap:  a = 9, b = 5
```

### Which Method Should You Use?

- Prefer the temporary variable method for clarity and safety.
- The arithmetic method can be a neat trick, but avoid it when values may overflow.
- XOR is an interesting technique; use it only when it adds real value and readability is not sacrificed.
