        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Javaistic ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to
          protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency. This Privacy Policy
          explains our practices regarding information handling on our open
          source educational platform for learning Java programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Javaistic does not require user accounts
          and does not collect personal information from visitors.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike many web platforms, Javaistic is designed as a static
          educational resource that does not collect personal information. We do
          not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Require user registration or accounts</li>
          <li>Collect names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
          <li>Track individual users or their behavior</li>
          <li>Store personal data in databases</li>
          <li>Use cookies for tracking or analytics</li>
          <li>Require payment information or billing details</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information We May Collect Automatically</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Server Logs</h3>
        <p>
          Like most websites, our web server may automatically log basic
          technical information when you visit the site, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP addresses (temporarily, for security purposes)</li>
          <li>Browser type and version</li>
          <li>Pages visited and time spent</li>
          <li>Referring website information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This information is used solely for website maintenance, security, and
          to improve the educational content. Logs are automatically deleted
          after a short period.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Open Source Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          If you choose to contribute to the Javaistic project through our
          public GitHub repository, any information you provide (such as GitHub
          username, email for commits, or pull request content) will be handled
          according to GitHub's privacy policies and our open source licensing
          terms.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Any information we may temporarily collect is used only for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining and improving the website's functionality</li>
          <li>Ensuring platform security and preventing abuse</li>
          <li>
            Analyzing general usage patterns to improve educational content
          </li>
          <li>Complying with legal obligations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not use information for marketing, advertising, or selling to
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Hosting Provider</h3>
        <p>
          Javaistic may be hosted on third-party platforms (such as Vercel,
          Netlify, or GitHub Pages). These providers may collect their own
          technical logs according to their privacy policies. We encourage you
          to review their policies if you have concerns.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 External Links</h3>
        <p>
          Our educational content may contain links to third-party websites,
          documentation, or resources. We are not responsible for the privacy
          practices of these external sites. Please review their privacy
          policies when visiting them.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Open Source Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
          Javaistic uses various open source libraries and frameworks. These
          dependencies may have their own data collection practices. We select
          dependencies carefully and prefer those with minimal or no data
          collection.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Since we do not collect personal information, data security concerns
          are minimal. However, we implement reasonable security measures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use of HTTPS encryption for all connections</li>
          <li>Regular security updates and maintenance</li>
          <li>Limited server access and monitoring</li>
          <li>Open source code allows for community security review</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Javaistic is an educational platform intended for learners of all ages
          interested in Java programming. Since we do not collect personal
          information, there are no special considerations for children's data.
          However, we recommend that children under 13 have parental guidance
          when accessing technical content.
        </p>

        <h2>8. International Users</h2>
        <p>
          As an open source educational platform, Javaistic is accessible
          worldwide. Since we do not collect personal information, international
          data transfer concerns do not apply to our service.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Open Source Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          Being an open source project, our code and practices are transparent
          and open to public review. This includes our privacy practices and any
          data handling procedures. Community members can review and contribute
          to improving our privacy protections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Javaistic uses a dual licensing model: source code is licensed under
          AGPL-3.0, while written content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. All
          licenses are publicly available in our repository.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
          in our practices or legal requirements. Changes will be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Committed to our public repository</li>
          <li>Documented in the change history</li>
          <li>Communicated through repository announcements or releases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Major changes that affect user privacy will be clearly highlighted.
        </p>
